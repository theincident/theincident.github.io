# Our Philosophy
At The Incident, we are dedicated to uncovering the truth and dismantling corruption in politics, economics, AI, and media. We believe that a free and open society requires independent journalism that is free from political or corporate influence. We are committed to providing our readers with accurate and factual information, free from bias and propaganda.

## Our Editorial Focus
Our editorial focus is on issues that matter to our readers. We cover stories that other news outlets may not cover, such as corruption in government and corporations, the erosion of free speech, and the dangers of propaganda. Our aim is to provide our readers with the information they need to make informed decisions and hold those in power accountable for their actions.

## Our Commitment to Integrity
As an independent journalism platform, we are committed to maintaining our integrity. We do not accept funding from political parties, corporations, or any other entities that may seek to influence our editorial content or decision making. Our commitment to journalistic integrity means that we prioritize the truth above all else and hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards.

## The Incident Oath
We believe that independent journalism requires a commitment to the values of free speech, transparency, and integrity. To that end, all members of The Incident guild are required to take the following oath:

"I solemnly swear to uphold the values of The Incident, including the constitutional values of free speech, transparency, and integrity. I will not allow my voice to be controlled by anyone, and I will always prioritize the truth above all else. I recognize that my role as a member of The Incident guild is built on honor, and I pledge to maintain the highest ethical standards in all of my journalistic endeavors."

## Similar to the Hippocratic Oath for doctors, our oath reflects our commitment to providing our readers with accurate and unbiased information, free from political or corporate influence. We believe that independent journalism is essential to a free and open society, and we are dedicated to upholding these values in everything we do.
