The case of Julian Assange is one of the most controversial and important stories of our time. Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has been held in Belmarsh prison in the UK for more than two years, and is currently fighting extradition to the United States, where he faces espionage charges for his role in publishing classified government documents.

Assange's case raises important questions about the limits of government power, the role of the media in a democratic society, and the need for transparency and accountability in government. It is a story that is shrouded in secrecy, misinformation, and political intrigue, and one that demands the attention of the public and the press.

At the heart of the matter is the question of what constitutes a crime in a society that values free speech and the freedom of the press. Assange and WikiLeaks have been responsible for publishing classified documents that have revealed the war crimes committed by the US government in Iraq and Afghanistan, including the killing of civilians, torture, and other abuses.

The publication of these documents has been a vital public service, as it has exposed the truth about the wars and the extent of the illegal actions undertaken by the US military in those countries. Yet, instead of being praised for their efforts to uncover the truth, Assange and WikiLeaks have been vilified and persecuted by the very governments that they have exposed.

The charges against Assange are based on corrupt interpretations of the law, and he is being accused of violating the Espionage Act, a law that was designed to prosecute spies who pass sensitive information to foreign governments. However, Assange is a journalist who was simply reporting on the actions of the US government. He did not pass any classified information to foreign governments or endanger national security.

Assange has suffered greatly by the abuse of the justice system for political and military protection. He has been held in solitary confinement, denied access to medical care, and his legal rights have been violated repeatedly. The extradition process has been marked by irregularities, and his lawyers have been prevented from presenting key evidence in his defense.

The continued persecution of Assange is a clear violation of freedom of the press and a threat to democracy. It is a story that must be told, and one that demands the attention and action of anyone who values the truth, freedom, and justice. In the following parts of this article, we will explore the details of Assange's case and the need for his release.

### The Crimes Assange Exposed

Julian Assange and WikiLeaks have been responsible for publishing some of the most important and damning documents in modern history, exposing the illegal actions of the US government in Iraq and Afghanistan. These documents have revealed the extent of the atrocities committed by the US military, including the killing of civilians, torture, and other abuses.

One of the most infamous documents published by WikiLeaks is the Collateral Murder video, which shows a US Apache helicopter crew killing more than a dozen unarmed civilians, including two Reuters journalists, in Baghdad in 2007. The video also shows the crew laughing and joking as they carry out the attack.

Other documents published by WikiLeaks have revealed the extent of the torture and abuse carried out by the US military at detention centers such as Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. These documents show that the US government engaged in systematic and widespread torture, including waterboarding and other forms of torture that are widely recognized as illegal under international law.

The publication of these documents has been a vital public service, as it has exposed the truth about the wars and the extent of the illegal actions undertaken by the US military in those countries. It has also been a wake-up call for the American people, who have been largely kept in the dark about the true nature of the wars and the actions of their government.

Despite the importance of these revelations, Assange and WikiLeaks have been vilified and persecuted by the very governments that they have exposed. The US government has charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act, despite the fact that he did not pass any classified information to foreign governments or endanger national security.

Assange's case highlights the importance of a free press and the need for transparency and accountability in government. It is a story that must be told and one that demands the attention and action of anyone who values truth, justice, and democracy.

### The Corrupt Charges Against Assange

Julian Assange is currently facing extradition to the United States, where he has been charged with 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act and one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. These charges are based on corrupt interpretations of the law and are a clear violation of freedom of the press.

The Espionage Act was designed to prosecute spies who pass sensitive information to foreign governments. It was never intended to be used against journalists or publishers who report on the actions of their government. Yet, that is exactly what is happening in Assange's case.

Assange is a journalist and publisher who was simply reporting on the actions of the US government. He did not pass any classified information to foreign governments or endanger national security. In fact, many of the documents published by WikiLeaks were already in the public domain or had been declassified.

The charges against Assange are a clear attempt to criminalize journalism and silence whistleblowers. If successful, these charges will have a chilling effect on press freedom and the ability of journalists to report on government abuses.

Furthermore, the extradition process has been marked by irregularities and violations of Assange's legal rights. He has been held in solitary confinement and denied access to medical care, in violation of international law. His lawyers have been prevented from presenting key evidence in his defense, and the extradition hearing has been rushed and unfair.

Assange's case is not just about him as an individual, but about the principles of democracy and freedom of the press. It is about the ability of journalists and publishers to report on the actions of their government without fear of persecution or retaliation.

The continued persecution of Assange is a clear violation of freedom of the press and a threat to democracy. It is a story that must be told, and one that demands the attention and action of anyone who values truth, justice, and democracy.

### The Abuse of the Justice System

The treatment of Julian Assange by the justice system is a clear abuse of power and a violation of his human rights. From the moment he was arrested, Assange has been subjected to a campaign of harassment, intimidation, and persecution.

Assange was initially arrested in 2010 in the UK on charges of sexual assault in Sweden. However, these charges were eventually dropped, and Assange was granted asylum by the government of Ecuador in 2012. Despite this, the UK government continued to pursue him, and in 2019, he was dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy and arrested by British authorities.

Since then, Assange has been held in Belmarsh Prison in London, where he has been denied access to adequate medical care and has been subjected to long periods of solitary confinement. The conditions of his detention are inhumane and a clear violation of his human rights.

Assange has also been denied access to his lawyers and has been prevented from preparing his defense properly. The extradition hearing has been rushed and unfair, and key evidence in his defense has been prevented from being presented in court.

The treatment of Assange by the justice system is a clear example of the abuse of power and the manipulation of the legal system for political and military protection. It is a violation of human rights and a threat to democracy and the rule of law.

The continued persecution of Assange by the justice system is a clear warning to whistleblowers and journalists who expose government abuses. It sends a message that those who speak out against power will be persecuted and punished, regardless of their legal and human rights.

The case of Assange is not just about him as an individual but about the principles of justice, democracy, and human rights. It is a story that must be told, and one that demands the attention and action of anyone who values truth, justice, and democracy.

### The Church Committee and the Government's Abuse of Power

The Church Committee, a Senate committee formed in the 1970s, was created with the intention of investigating and curbing the government's ability to spy on its citizens. It was a response to the revelations of illegal domestic spying by the FBI and other government agencies during the Nixon administration.

The Church Committee uncovered widespread abuses of power by government agencies, including the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA. It revealed that these agencies had been engaging in illegal domestic surveillance, spying on political opponents, and even attempting to assassinate foreign leaders.

As a result of the Church Committee's investigations, laws were passed to prevent government agencies from engaging in such abuses of power. However, since 9/11, the government has been caught repeatedly abusing the rights of its citizens through mass surveillance schemes and abuse of the legal system.

The government's abuse of power is exemplified by the case of Julian Assange. Assange exposed war crimes committed by the US military, crimes that were being covered up by the government. Rather than addressing these crimes, the government has focused its efforts on persecuting Assange and silencing the press.

This abuse of power is further evidenced by the fact that many government projects are funded as black money operations, allowing illegal activities to be carried out with impunity. The hypocrisy of the government's position is evident, as it claims to be promoting democracy and human rights while engaging in illegal activities and suppressing free speech.

The continued persecution of Assange by the government is a clear example of the abuse of power and the manipulation of the legal system for political and military protection. It is a violation of human rights and a threat to democracy and the rule of law.

The Church Committee's investigations showed the importance of curbing the government's ability to spy on its citizens and abuse its power. The continued abuse of power by the government, as exemplified by the case of Assange, is a clear warning of the dangers of allowing such abuses to continue unchecked.

### The Hypocrisy of the Situation

The persecution of Julian Assange by the US government is a clear example of the hypocrisy of the situation. The government claims to promote democracy, freedom of speech, and human rights, yet it engages in illegal activities and violates these same principles.

Assange's exposure of war crimes committed by the US military should have been a call to action for the government to address these crimes and hold those responsible accountable. Instead, the government has focused its efforts on persecuting Assange and suppressing free speech, effectively protecting those who committed these war crimes.

Furthermore, the government's use of black money operations to fund illegal activities is a clear violation of democratic principles and the rule of law. This hypocritical behavior undermines the US's moral authority and credibility on the world stage, calling into question its commitment to upholding democratic values and human rights.

The government's abuse of power and manipulation of the legal system to protect itself and its interests is a dangerous precedent. It sets a precedent for future abuses of power and undermines the very foundations of democracy and the rule of law.

The US government must recognize the hypocrisy of its actions and take steps to address the crimes committed by its military, rather than focusing its efforts on persecuting those who expose these crimes. It must also take steps to prevent future abuses of power and ensure that democratic principles and the rule of law are upheld at all times.

In conclusion, the persecution of Julian Assange and the hypocrisy of the US government's actions serve as a warning of the dangers of unchecked government power and the importance of upholding democratic principles and the rule of law.

### The Need to Release Assange

The persecution of Julian Assange by the US government is not only a violation of democratic principles and the rule of law, but also a threat to the freedom of the press and free speech. The charges against Assange are based on corrupt interpretations of the law, and his extradition to the US would set a dangerous precedent for the suppression of investigative journalism and whistleblowers.

Assange's exposure of war crimes committed by the US military is a public service and should be protected under the First Amendment. His prosecution sets a dangerous precedent for journalists and whistleblowers who seek to hold those in power accountable for their actions.

Furthermore, Assange's treatment in custody has been a clear abuse of the justice system. He has been subjected to prolonged isolation and psychological torture, which has had a severe impact on his mental and physical health.

It is essential that the US government release Julian Assange and drop all charges against him. The freedom of the press and free speech must be protected, and whistleblowers must be able to come forward without fear of retribution.

Moreover, the US government must address the war crimes committed by its military and hold those responsible accountable. Only by acknowledging and addressing these crimes can the US restore its moral authority and credibility on the world stage.

The release of Julian Assange is not only a matter of justice for him, but also a matter of upholding democratic principles and protecting the freedom of the press and free speech. The US government must take action to address the crimes committed by its military and protect whistleblowers who seek to hold those in power accountable.
