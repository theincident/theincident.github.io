As much as I dislike it, taxes have been a fundamental part of the United States' history from its very inception. From the earliest days of colonial America, taxes have been used to fund the government and provide for the common good. However, the history of taxes in the United States is a complex and often contentious one, filled with debates over the role of government and the appropriate level of taxation especially between the rich and the poor. 

The first taxes in the United States were implemented by the British colonial government in the 17th and 18th centuries. These taxes were primarily levied on goods such as tea, sugar, and molasses, and were intended to raise revenue to support British colonial interests. However, the colonists chafed under these taxes, seeing them as an infringement on their rights and liberties because it was fundamentally making their lives more difficult.

This tension over taxes came to a head in the late 18th century, when the colonists rebelled against British rule and established the United States as an independent nation. In the early years of the new nation, taxes were used primarily to fund the government and pay off debts from the Revolutionary War but most of those taxes were paid by the rich who also bargained for differing levels of control.

Over time, the role of taxes in American society expanded, as the government took on a greater role in providing for the common good. During the 20th century, taxes were used to fund a range of government programs, from Social Security to Medicare to the Interstate Highway System. Many of these programs were built under the premise of making our lives better.

However, the history of taxes in the United States has been marked by periods of controversy and debate. Many politicians and thinkers have argued that taxes were too high and that the government was too big. At one point this led to a series of tax cuts in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan, which were designed to stimulate economic growth and reduce the size of government, but in reality the cuts went on to aid corporate power and minimize regulations of monopolies. 

Despite these efforts to reduce taxes, the role of taxes in American society remains a contentious issue. Today, many Americans argue that taxes are too high and that the government is too involved in their lives. Others argue that taxes are necessary to fund important programs and services, and that the government has a responsibility to provide for the common good.

One thing is clear: the history of taxes in the United States is a complex and nuanced one, filled with debates over the role of government and the appropriate level of taxation. 

The early years of the United States were marked by a contentious debate over the role and scope of the federal government, including its power to tax. Many Americans, particularly those in rural areas, were deeply suspicious of centralized authority and feared that a strong federal government would become tyrannical.

This sentiment was reflected in the Whiskey Rebellion of 1791, when farmers in western Pennsylvania rebelled against a federal excise tax on whiskey. President George Washington, recognizing the danger of such an uprising, called up a militia to suppress the rebellion and enforce the tax.

The reality of taxes is that it has become a corrupted mechanism of the state. When you are the richest country in the world, you have an opportunity to create a new form of transaction process that can algorithmically benefit the entire world by reducing waste and minimizing the cost of constant abuse.
