In the aftermath of 20 years of military debacles in the Middle East, the question remains: who must be held accountable for the crimes committed? The answer is the politicians and shills in the media who orchestrated the wars and who seek a world dominated by U.S. power.

The architects of these debacles have never been held accountable and remain ensconced in power. They continue to promote permanent war, including the ongoing proxy war in Ukraine against Russia, as well as a future war against China.

## The Big Lie

The politicians who lied to us — George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden to name a few — extinguished millions of lives, including thousands of American lives, and left Iraq along with Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen in chaos. They exaggerated or fabricated conclusions from intelligence reports to mislead the public. The big lie is taken from the playbook of totalitarian regimes.

### The Cheerleaders in the Media

The cheerleaders in the media for war — Thomas Friedman, David Remnick, Richard Cohen, George Packer, William Kristol, Peter Beinart, Bill Keller, Robert Kaplan, Anne Applebaum, Nicholas Kristof, Jonathan Chait, Fareed Zakaria, David Frum, Jeffrey Goldberg, David Brooks, and Michael Ignatieff — were used to amplify the lies and discredit the handful of us, including Michael Moore, Robert Scheer, and Phil Donahue, who opposed the war. These courtiers were often motivated more by careerism than idealism. They did not lose their megaphones or lucrative speaking fees and book contracts once the lies were exposed, as if their crazed diatribes did not matter. They served the centers of power and were rewarded for it.

### Pushing Further Escalation

Many of these same pundits are pushing further escalation of the war in Ukraine, although most know as little about Ukraine or NATO’s provocative and unnecessary expansion to the borders of Russia as they did about Iraq.

“I told myself and others that Ukraine is the most important story of our time, that everything we should care about is on the line there,” George Packer writes in The Atlantic magazine. “I believed it then, and I believe it now, but all of this talk put a nice gloss on the simple, unjustifiable desire to be there and see.”

Packer views war as a purgative, a force that will jolt a country, including the U.S., back to the core moral values he supposedly found amongst American volunteers in Ukraine.

“I didn’t know what these men thought of American politics, and I didn’t want to know,” he writes of two U.S. volunteers. “Back home we might have argued; we might have detested each other. Here, we were joined by a common belief in what the Ukrainians were trying to do and admiration for how they were doing it. Here, all the complex infighting and chronic disappointments and sheer lethargy of any democratic society, but especially ours, dissolved, and the essential things — to be free and live with dignity — became clear.

This failure of accountability is a dangerous precedent, as it reinforces the notion that those in power can act with impunity and without regard for the consequences of their actions. As long as the architects of these debacles are able to remain in power, the threat of future disastrous military interventions will continue to loom over us.

The only way to prevent future catastrophes is to hold those responsible for the past failures accountable. This means investigating and punishing those who lied, fabricated evidence, and misled the public into supporting these wars. It also means taking steps to dismantle the structures of power that enabled these individuals to operate with impunity.

## Failure to Hold Those Responsible Accountable

We must also recognize the role that the media played in promoting these wars. Rather than being an independent watchdog, the media became a cheerleader for war, amplifying the lies and discrediting those who opposed the war. This failure of the media highlights the importance of a free and independent press in holding those in power accountable.
